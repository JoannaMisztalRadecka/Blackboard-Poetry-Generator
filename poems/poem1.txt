Daniel and I felt so, so very fortunate to go here.  
The timing could not have been more perfect for us  as our last few days in New York had been quite hectic. 
 We had been trying to wrap our heads around  our lives without anymore more fertility treatments.  
 Then we planned this rather last minute trip (because the airfare was cheaper if we left sooner). 
  So we quickly had to find a real estate agent and prepare our Brooklyn home to be shown while we were away.
   And we also got a head start on the paperwork for our resident visas in Ecuador, just in case we did decide we were going to move here.  
   It was all quite a whirlwind. 

We barely got packed and out the door...
