I wake up my mom and broke the news to her and let me tell you she was PISSED, lol. I got yelled at the whole way back 6 hours home. Then half way home to court, my lawyer calls and tell me "Well they closed court early at 1pm and they said they are charging you with a FTA and $1000 secure bond." I'm like "Are you kidding me?!!!!!! Ill get to court before 4pm when it's REALLY over with." And he just told me that I had to hand myself in, bond out, then they will drop my charges." I have no idea why in the world they did that to me to make myself end up in the media again for the wrong reasons.

Lately everyone has been wondering "Is Jenelle and Gary going to get back together?!". NO! He is living his life and I'm living mine. We are both happy with our lives the way they are at the moment, I know for me at least I'm EXTREMELY happy. Gary might of been tweeting things because he might of been jealous in a way that I was dating Courtland but he agrees to stop today.

Overnight we had a light dusting of snow, and basically the whole city has shut down since. And I don't blame them. I almost died trying to get a couple pictures of the "snow" out on my front driveway this morning. Treacherours conditions, indeed. But no seriously. Be careful this morning, fellow Texans! That ice is slick!

So much easier said than done. But today I’m asking myself for grace. And calm. And peace. I want to ENJOY my work. And then I want to ENJOY my life. At the end of this day, my work will not be finished. I will not be “all caught up.” I don’t think “all caught up” will exist for me anymore. But it IS important to understand when work is done for the day. It IS important to stop using the “busy” language.  YOU create the environment you exist in. You create it with your words and with your actions. With how much work you take on, and the price tag you place on your time. So my project now is to be mindful of creating that serenity I so crave in my life. To choose it and embody it and be it, for myself and those around me.
