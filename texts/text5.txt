Lately everyone has been wondering "Is Jenelle and Gary going to get back together?!". NO! He is living his life and I'm living mine. We are both happy with our lives the way they are at the moment, I know for me at least I'm EXTREMELY happy. Gary might of been tweeting things because he might of been jealous in a way that I was dating Courtland but he agrees to stop today.
