Hey guys!
How are you? I hope you all are having a great holiday season! : )
Since I've spent a majority of my life living in Miami, I'm always looking for ways to help give back by supporting local causes and the community. Kids hold a special place in my heart and I'm hoping you'll take a moment to help a local school, South Pointe Elementary, collect enough votes to improve their school security systems. All you have to do is text '99222' and type 'South Pointe Elementary'. (check first with your cell phone carrier to see if any charges will apply)
