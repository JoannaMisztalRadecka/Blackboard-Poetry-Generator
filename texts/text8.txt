with the holiday craziness yesterday, and having to work, i didn't get to finish posting all of my thankfulness pictures. so you might see them pop up over the next few days.this morning i am thankful for the adult men in my life. my dad and mr p. i am fortunate to have both of them in my life to encourage me, support me, take care of me, and love the kids with all of their hearts.
